go-sqlite3
==========

DESCRIPTION
-----------

sqlite3 driver conforming to the built-in database/sql interface

INSTALLATION
------------

It requires `pkg-config`.  You can also confirm that permissions and dependancies are setup by running `pkg-config --cflags --libs sqlite3`.

If you are using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) on Mac OS X, you can install with:

    brew install pkgconfig
    brew install sqlite3
     
If you are using Ubuntu, you can install with:

    sudo apt-get install pkg-config
	sudo apt-get install sqlite3  
	sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev 
	
If you are using Windows, you can get pkg-config from below.

http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/

Go does not support static linking for external C library; sqlite3 should be built as a shared library. If it runs on Windows, it needs dll.

Finally, this package can be installed with the go get command:

    go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
